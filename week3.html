                  From this viewpoint search engines become socio-epistemological machines, authoring source standing for a given subject matter.

                  Search engine companies have changed the definition of the relevance of a source from an evaluative scheme based on inlink count (and the content of the link) to one that combines inlink with click count and freshness.

                  The question becomes whether one can make use of the source standing authored by engines as a research practice, and to which ends.

                  Can one perform source standing research with Google, or is one always studying Google itself?

                  In groups of three, install a research browser on your computer and come up with a topic of interest you wish to study. Compare the search between two national google pages and prepare a three minute presentation of your results.

                  You'll be up at the front of the room, ensure your talk has an introduction to your research question, a description of your method, and a summary of your findings. You will also need to evaluate how successful your project was.
