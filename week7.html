                    In the seminar today I would like us to explore our own social networks using <a href="http://www.lostcircles.com/">Lost Circles</a>, a Chrome extension which will produce a visualization of your social network.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To do this you will need to: a) use Facebook, b) use Chrome, and c) (hopefully) be willing to discuss your results with the group.

                    Whilst taking part in the discussion and exercise is important, using the tool and/or sharing your results with the group is not essential - and is up to you.
                    It would be great, however, if at least a few people volunteered so we could explore this in groups.

                    Collecting the data takes some time. So, I would like us to start off installing the tool and collecting the data now, so we can come back to it later.

                  In groups, you have two to three minutes to come up with five key terms related to networks, alongside their definitions.
                  Once time is up, we'll go through and write them all up on the board.
                  Points for groups who come up with more unusual terms.
