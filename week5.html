                <p>
                  In groups of three, I want you to undertake a practice digital methods research project and produce a plan on a sheet of flipchart paper, just like I did last week
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can choose any topic to research, but I want you to produce the four different sections (in quadrants) like I did on the whiteboard, and show how you would take a research method, devse research questions, and then produce a report plan based on either preliminary or supposed findings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each team will report back to the rest of the group in the final few minutes of the seminar.
