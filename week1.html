                  In groups of four, refer to the slides from this week's lecture on KEATS. Pick one example from the list of studies given, and discuss what your chosen study can tell us about society, but also what it can tell us about our relationship with digital technologies, too.

                <p>
                  Devise an idea for a similar digital methods study and discuss what data you would look at, and what you might learn about society and its relationships with the internet.
